### How It Works

#### **Daily Theme**

Each day introduces a new music theme to inspire creativity. Themes can reflect moods, genres, or cultural trends, ensuring fresh and exciting challenges for participants.

#### **Generate Music**

Users create unique music tracks by submitting creative prompts based on the daily theme. The platform uses sound generation tools to produce a track for each prompt.

#### **Community Voting**
After submissions are closed, the community votes for their favorite music tracks.


#### **Win and Earn**

At the end of the day, submissions with the highest votes are declared winners. Users who voted for the winning submissions also earn a share of the rewards, encouraging thoughtful and strategic voting.

### **Prize Distribution Logic**

1.  **No Submissions**:  
    If there are no submissions, no winners are declared.
    
2.  **Less Than 5 Submissions**:  
    If there are fewer than 5 submissions, only **1 winner** is selected.
    
3.  **5 or More Submissions**:  
    If there are 5 or more submissions, **3 winners** are selected based on the number of votes they received.
    
4.  **Voter Share Calculation**:
    
    -   The total **voter share** is calculated based on the total number of winners and the number of voters.
    -   **Winner weight** is 3 times the weight of a voter.
5.  **Voter Reward Distribution**:  
    The total **voter share** is divided equally among all voters who voted for any of the top winners, incentivizing participation and promoting voters to choose wisely.
    
6.  **Winner Reward Distribution**:
    
    -   The **winner share** is divided among the top winners based on the ratio of votes they received.
    -   For example, if Winner 1 got 50 votes, and Winner 2 got 30 votes, their share of the reward will be proportional to those vote counts.
